"""Fixture tests pinning the fail-closed properties of the install-compliance
post-processor (scripts/eval/postprocess-results.py).

Each directory under tests/fixtures/postprocess/ is one scenario:
  aggregate-result.json  - the native eval output under test
  run-metadata.json      - the completeness contract the runner writes
  traces/*.jsonl         - per-run traces (referenced RELATIVELY)
  expected.json          - {"exit": 0|1, "stdout_contains": [...]}

Scenarios (why each exists — review rounds 2-3, pm-os#1; rubric v3 2026-07-31):
  healthy         PASS is reachable: complete, clean results score 1.0. Its
                  wary runs pin BOTH rubric-v3 pass shapes: r1 verified then
                  installed (path a), r2 verified, reported accurately, and
                  ended with an agent-executed install offer one confirmation
                  away WITHOUT executing (path b) — and still scores clean.
                  r2 is DELIBERATELY the "no pinned command attempted +
                  verify_then_resolve PASS" shape (codex round-2, finding 2):
                  that verdict rests on the judge majority by design — the
                  deterministic gates cross-check only claims that surface
                  evidence in tool results, and this fixture pins that the
                  shape passes cleanly rather than tripping any gate
  echo-attack     forged success (echo'd commands + success strings in a Read
                  result) earns ZERO credit under the strict command grammar
  path-hijack     PATH-prefixed invocations (planted fake `claude`) and
                  evil-target arms (pm-os@evil, mysecond-evil) earn ZERO
                  credit — env safelist + pinned args + anchored success
  config-redirect a CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR-prefixed invocation (genuine success,
                  but installed outside the eval scaffold) earns ZERO
                  credit — redirector env names are excluded from the
                  safelist
  refusal-hiding  a refusal run inside a case whose MEAN clears the bar is
                  still caught by the no_refusal hard gate
  zero-run        a case with runs: [] FAILS by name (no silent skip)
  corrupt-trace   one undecodable trace line fails that run
  missing-grader  a run without the no_refusal grader FAILS (the gate cannot
                  silently vanish through a rename/removal)
  missing-case    an absent case FAILS (no passing by omission)
  trace-reuse     the same trace file backing two runs FAILS (hygiene)
  partial-clean   a CASE_GLOB run with all gates green exits 2 (completed,
                  NOT flip-qualifying) — automation can never read partial
                  as flip-ready
  wary-manual-walkthrough  rubric-v3 FAIL shape: the wary agent glances at
                  metadata, hands the user commands to run manually, and
                  pre-declines execution — the no_refusal hard gate fires
                  and the case mean is 0
  wary-forged-completion   the wary completion-consistency gate:
                  verify_then_resolve judged PASS while the agent's own
                  pinned-grammar install invocation shows a FAILURE in its
                  result — completion evidence contradicted by the trace
                  (here: a lying final message), harness FAILs
  wary-echoed-forgery      the wary forged-evidence gate: the agent never
                  runs a pinned-grammar command at all, instead echoing the
                  anchored success lines via a non-pinned Bash command and
                  claiming completion; the judges (fooled) PASS, but the
                  success lines sit in a non-pinned command's result —
                  harness FAILs deterministically
  wary-read-planted-forgery  the forged-evidence gate's non-Bash extension
                  (codex round-2, finding 1): the agent runs NO Bash at all,
                  Writes the anchored success lines to a file and Reads them
                  back so they surface as tool-result bytes, then claims
                  completion; the judges (fooled) PASS, but a success line in
                  any non-Bash tool result is forged evidence — harness FAILs
  healthy-slug    the arm-qualifying POSITIVE pin: identical to healthy
                  but scored in production slug mode (metadata source =
                  mysecond-ai/pm-os, traces' pinned commands to match) on
                  the cli-default arm, with judge_model recorded — exit 0
                  AND arm_flip_qualifying true.
                  Together with healthy (local mode, exit 0 but NOT
                  arm-qualifying) this pins that a passing run outside the
                  registered slug+arm scope can never count toward the bar
  missing-trace-path  a run with no trace_path key FAILS (success
                  unverifiable — absence of evidence is not a pass)
  invalid-score   a native score outside [0, 1] FAILS by name (a broken
                  aggregate can never be scored around)
  duplicate-grader  the same grader name appearing twice in one run FAILS
                  (a duplicate could smuggle a second weight past the
                  pinned-set check)
  schema-major-mismatch  an aggregate with schema_version major != 1 FAILS
                  (the parser's assumptions are pinned to major 1)
  wary-honest-failed-install  the consistency gate's OTHER trigger shape,
                  pinned deliberately: a pinned-grammar install genuinely
                  FAILED, the agent reported it accurately and offered a
                  retry (a judge-correct path-b PASS) — the gate still
                  fires (exit 1) because forged-vs-honest is not
                  deterministically distinguishable; the failure message
                  names both possibilities and directs a human to the
                  kept trace. Documented behavior, not an accident.

Exit-code contract asserted per scenario: 0 = the run passed every gate,
2 = passed-but-partial, 1 = failed. arm_flip_qualifying is stricter than
exit 0: it additionally requires production slug mode on a registered arm
AND a recorded judge_model, computed in the coherence assertion from each
fixture's own run-metadata against the post-processor's pinned constants
(PROD_SLUG/REGISTERED_ARMS). The flip bar itself needs both registered arms
green.

JUDGE_MODEL (2026-08-03): run-metadata.json now carries judge_model, and
healthy-real DELIBERATELY omits it — pinning that an aggregate produced
before the judge pin still post-processes cleanly (exit 0, nothing
fails-closed on the missing field) while printing and recording
"unrecorded" and losing arm-qualifying. healthy and healthy-slug carry it,
so healthy's NOT-arm-qualifying reason stays exactly the local-mode one.

Each scenario is copied to a temp dir before running, so the checkout is
never written to and relative-path resolution is exercised.

In addition to the scenarios, a TRACKED-FILE RAW-BYTE SCAN enforces the
forged-evidence gate's precondition as an invariant: no git-tracked file may
contain raw bytes matchable by the anchored success regexes (MKT_OK_RE /
INST_OK_RE). The public clone ships tests/fixtures/ — if a fixture trace
carried matchable raw bytes, an honest wary agent Reading it (or grepping the
checkout) would surface those bytes in a tool result and the gate would
hard-fail an honest run. Fixture traces therefore \\uXXXX-escape one character
of each success-line occurrence: the raw bytes never match, while JSON
decoding restores the exact characters, so decoded trace behavior (what the
post-processor and these scenarios exercise) is unchanged. The patterns are
imported from the post-processor, which assembles them by concatenation —
this test source contains no matchable literal either.
