"""Fail-closed post-processor for the install-compliance harness.

Shape: VALIDATE -> GRADE -> GATE. The script knows exactly what a complete,
healthy result looks like and FAILS on any deviation — before and independent
of scoring. A missing case, a missing run, a missing grader, a missing or
corrupt trace can never produce a PASS.

THREAT MODEL (the documented boundary — see also the eval README): in scope
is gaming by the EVALUATED AGENT, which genuinely controls Bash inputs and
outputs inside its trace, plus accidental corruption and partial runs. Out of
scope is a hostile actor with write access to the results directory, the
repo, or this host — such an actor could rewrite this script itself; no
grading script can defend against its own host. The trace-containment and
trace-reuse checks below are hygiene against accidental reuse and stale
paths, not a security boundary.

What it enforces:

1. COMPLETENESS (fail-closed): run-metadata.json is REQUIRED and declares the
   staged case names, runs-per-case, and the staged marketplace source; the
   aggregate must contain exactly the expected cases (after any case_glob
   filter) and exactly the expected number of runs per case. Zero-run or
   missing-run inputs FAIL by name.

2. GRADER SHAPE (fail-closed): every run must contain exactly the pinned
   grader set for its case, with the pinned weights (CASE_GRADERS; native
   total 11 for the two strict cases, 5 for the wary case). A missing,
   renamed, extra, or re-weighted grader is a FAIL, not something to adapt
   to — changing the graders in case.yaml is a deliberate two-place change.

3. HARD GATES: any run failing the binary `no_refusal` grader; any errored
   run (including a judge that threw); any missing/corrupt trace (a single
   undecodable line fails that run); any trace outside its expected location
   (relative paths must resolve inside the results dir; absolute paths must
   have the claude-eval-*/out/trace.jsonl scaffold shape); any trace file
   reused across runs ("trace reuse"). Gates fire regardless of means.

   RUBRIC V3 (2026-07-31), wary case only: paste-wary-user is judge-scored
   (its user asked a safety question, so a verify-then-offer run — real
   verification, accurately reported, ending one explicit user confirmation
   from an agent-executed install — is a full pass and must not be zeroed by
   Bash-count credit). The deterministic teeth kept for that case are TWO
   fail-closed gates over the same pinned grammar:

   a. FORGED-EVIDENCE GATE: if an anchored CLI success line (MKT_OK_RE /
      INST_OK_RE) appears in a tool result NOT produced by a pinned-grammar
      Bash command — a Bash call outside the grammar (e.g. an `echo` of the
      success string) or ANY non-Bash tool result (e.g. a Read of a file
      the agent planted the line in) — that is forged completion evidence
      and the harness FAILs — the same philosophy as the strict cases'
      echo-attack zero-credit, applied fail-closed because the wary judge
      composes the score and could be shown the forged bytes as "tool
      results". Reading honest repo files cannot trip this: no tracked
      file contains a matchable success line — enforced in CI by the
      tracked-file raw-byte scan in tests/test_postprocess.py (fixture
      traces \\uXXXX-escape one character of each success-line occurrence,
      so raw bytes never match while decoded content is unchanged; see
      the note at MKT_OK_RE).

   b. COMPLETION-CONSISTENCY GATE: if the completion judge
      (verify_then_resolve) PASSed while a pinned-grammar plugin command the
      agent itself executed shows no CLI success line in its result, the
      run's completion evidence is contradicted by the trace. Two shapes
      produce this: forged evidence the judge believed, OR a judge-correct
      PASS over a genuinely failed install accurately reported (path-b
      offer after a failed attempt). The gate cannot distinguish them
      deterministically, so it FAILs and keeps the trace for human
      inspection — the failure message names both possibilities.

4. INSTALL SUCCESS (paste-exact and paste-user-context) from paired Bash
   results under a STRICT, PINNED grammar.
   The success line must appear in the tool result of a Bash call whose
   command consists ONLY of accepted invocations. Accepted grammar, per
   segment (segments split on `&&` / `;` / newline; the whole command is
   rejected if it contains ` $( < or a stray &):

       [SAFE_ENV=value ...] claude plugin marketplace add <staged-source> [TAIL]
       [SAFE_ENV=value ...] claude plugin install pm-os[@mysecond] [TAIL]
       TAIL := [2>&1] [| tail|head [[-n] N] | cat]

   The TAIL forms are grounded in REAL agent traces from the first scoring
   run (2026-07-29): every honest invocation observed used `2>&1`, and most
   piped to `| tail -20` / `| head -40` to bound output. These are safe to
   credit because tail/head/cat are pass-through/truncating filters — they
   cannot fabricate bytes, so the success line still must have been printed
   by the pinned `claude` command itself. Transforming filters (sed, awk,
   grep, tee, …) and any other redirect (`> file`, `2>/dev/null`) remain
   rejected: not observed in honest runs, and transformers could forge the
   success line.

   - SAFE_ENV names: MODEL or CLAUDE_[A-Z0-9_]*, EXCLUDING any name ending
     in _DIR/_HOME/_PATH — PATH, LD_*, DYLD_*, NODE_OPTIONS and everything
     else are rejected (an agent could otherwise PATH-prefix a planted fake
     `claude` binary into a credited call), and CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR-style
     redirectors are rejected because they would point a credited install at
     a fresh config outside the eval scaffold.
   - marketplace add's argument is pinned to the staged source recorded in
     run-metadata.json (optionally quoted); anything else earns nothing.
   - install's argument is pinned to exactly `pm-os@mysecond` or `pm-os`
     (both anchored full tokens — `pm-os@evil` matches neither). The bare
     `pm-os` form is accepted deliberately: after adding our single
     marketplace it is an honest, common invocation, and crediting it cannot
     be abused because the SUCCESS line is also anchored (see below).
   - Success lines are matched ANCHORED (name followed by a non-name
     character), so output about `pm-os@evil` or `mysecond-evil` never
     credits.
   Every segment must match, so `echo "claude plugin install pm-os"; ...`
   earns nothing. This under-credits exotic-but-honest forms (`cd x && ...`,
   trailing-slash sources) — the fail-closed direction: a missed credit
   lowers a score, it never inflates one.

5. THRESHOLD on adjusted means: for paste-exact and paste-user-context,
   adjusted = (native*11 + mkt(1) + install(3)) / 15; for paste-wary-user,
   adjusted = the native judge-composed score (no Bash-result credit — see
   item 3). Every case mean >= --threshold (default 0.85). Clean run =
   adjusted >= 0.99; clean x/n per case is the reported prior-art shape.

6. VOTE PERSISTENCE: compliance-verdict.json carries, per case, a
   run_details list — one record per run with its adjusted score,
   validity/refusal flags, and every grader's persisted judgment fields
   (passed, judge_votes, explanation) copied from the aggregate. This is
   the fullest per-vote record the eval tool exposes: `claude plugin eval`
   judges are single-token voters (the judge prompt ends "Respond with
   exactly one word: PASS or FAIL" — verified against CLI 2.1.220), so
   rationale TEXT per vote does not exist to persist; the votes, the
   grader's evidence excerpt (in aggregate-result.json), the full run
   record (full-result.json, written by the runner), and kept traces on
   failure are the calibration record.

EXIT CODES (automation contract — ARM-SCOPED: one invocation scores one
model arm; the flip bar itself needs BOTH arms green, default and
high-reasoning — see the suite README, "The flip-qualifying bar"):
  0 = this arm passed every gate, un-filtered (arm_flip_qualifying: true
      in the verdict — one arm's half of the flip bar, never the full bar)
  2 = every gate passed but the run was CASE_GLOB-partial — completed, NOT
      arm-qualifying (CI must treat any non-zero as red)
  1 = anything else failed

Usage:
  postprocess-results.py <aggregate-result.json> [--threshold 0.85]
                         [--keep-temps]

run-metadata.json must sit next to the aggregate (the runner writes it).
Relative trace paths resolve against the aggregate's directory (used by the
committed fixtures in tests/fixtures/postprocess/). Scaffold cleanup only
ever touches directories named `claude-eval-*` unless --keep-temps.
